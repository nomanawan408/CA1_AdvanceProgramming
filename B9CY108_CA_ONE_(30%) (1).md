Create a class ContactBook that contains data and methods providing the functionalities as mentioned above. The contact book should have min.20 contacts. (min.20 objects of the class ‘ContactBook’ to store 20 distinct persons). Make use of suitable data structure. The code should accept a non-zero, 9-digit, positive number as mobile number and reject all invalid data gracefully.  

Your C# code should exhibit the following Object-Oriented principles: 

Classes & Objects, Encapsulation, Properties, Access Modifiers, Method Overloading, Object Relationships. 

(Marks 30) 

**Que. 2.**  Write a C# program that implements a system, which assists users by providing 

information  about  file  extension.  (e.g.  .mp4,  .mov,  .avi,  .mkv,  .webm  etc.)  Your program should support inquiries for min 20 file extensions of your choice. Make use of suitable data structures in your code. Program should handle unexpected enquiries and respond gracefully.   

`             `(Marks 20) 

**CA\_ONE – part II : Programming in Python** 

**Que. 3.**  Consider the following scenario, design and implement a solution to complete 

the  tasks:  

Students apply for admission to DBS for the following courses: MSc in Cyber Security, MSc Information Systems & computing, MSc Data Analytics. 

Applicants are required to submit the following information: 

- Name 
- Address 
- Educational qualifications 
- The course they wish to enroll in 
- Intended start year and month 

Upon receiving the application, DBS assigns a unique application number for reference in all future correspondence. 

**Tasks:**  

1. Develop a console-based client application that accepts information from applicant.  
1. Implement a server that receives the applicant’s information from client and stores it in a database. (Make use of disk persistent relational database, or document database) 
1. The server then generates a unique registration number for the user and sends it back to the client to provide to the user. 

Implement  the  client-server  application  using  connectionless  protocol-  UDP  or connection-oriented  protocol  -  TCP.  Ensure  that  security  factors  are  taken  into consideration.  

(Submit Que3\_server.py, Que3\_client.py, screenshots showing successful connection established between the client and the server and data transmission) 

(Marks 30) 

**Que. 4.** 

Develop and implement a system that extracts and consolidates hotel room price data from two chosen establishments in a popular holiday destination during a specified seasonal period (e.g., 20–30 December). The system should gather information for at least ten rooms and present the data in a structured format, enabling prospective customers  to  perform  comparative  analysis  and  make  informed  accommodation decisions. It is essential to ensure that the data sources selected explicitly authorize the legal extraction of the required content. 

1. Write a Python code to scrape the webpages for the required data. 
1. Store the data in csv file.   
1. At the end of the program, retrieve all data from csv file and display in the terminal window. 

Use the appropriate Python modules to scrape the webpage and work with csv file. Submit the resulting csv file.

**General Requirements for Students: ![](Aspose.Words.064827d0-254c-4df1-98be-516a23cb15a9.004.png)**

1. A  proportion  of  assessment  marks  is  allocated  to  presentation.  All  assignments  must  be  word- processed, with word count noted unless otherwise stated by the lecturer. 
1. Where a hardcopy submission is required, an Assignment Submission Form must be securely attached to each submission.  
1. All assignments must be submitted no later than the stated deadline.  

   Any CA must be submitted through Moodle by the specified submission deadline, unless an IT issue has precluded this. Any IT issue must be documented and notified to the Programme Coordinator in advance of the submission date.   

   A penalty of two marks per day will be applied per day or part thereof for an ongoing failure to submit beyond the submission deadline. For the purposes of these penalties, a day is defined as any day of the week, including weekends and public holidays when the College may be closed. An examiner has the right to refuse to mark the assessment if the submission instructions have not been observed.  

- Where a late assessment, submitted within 14 days of the deadline, is of a passing standard (i.e. would achieve more than 40% in the normal scheme of things), the late penalty is capped such that the minimum grade that can be awarded is 40% for the late submission.   
- Where a late assessment is submitted more than 14 days after the deadline, it will receive 0%. The lecturer may, at their discretion, review the submission for feedback.   

Where an assessment is undertaken in a group, the piece of work should be submitted in its entirety, and any penalty for late submission incurred applies to all group members. Any learner who becomes aware that a group deadline will not be achieved through a lack of participation of another group member, should make this clearly known to the examiner in advance of the deadline. 

4. All relevant provisions of the Assessment Regulations must be complied with. 
4. Extensions to assignment submission deadlines will be not be granted, other than in exceptional circumstances.  To apply for an extension please go to[ http://www.dbs-students.com/Registrar/ ](http://www.dbs-students.com/Registrar/)and download the Assignment Extension Request Form.  *Once completed* *this form should then be returned to your Programme Leader, for approval.* 
4. Students are required to retain a copy of each assignment submitted, and the submission receipt (If a physical submission is required) until the issuing of a transcript indicating the mark awarded. 
4. Assignments must be appropriately packaged and presented. 
8. Where a submission involves digital media, it is the submitting students’ responsibility to ensure the media is appropriately labelled, fully working and they must retain a copy.  
8. Assignments that *breach* the word count requirements will be penalised.  *There is a 10% discretion, either way, applicable in terms of word count.* 
8. Students are required to refer to the assessment regulations in their Student Guides and on the Student Website.
